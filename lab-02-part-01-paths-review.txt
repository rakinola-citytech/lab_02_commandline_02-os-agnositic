==========
Feel free to use your workstation to test your answers to the questions that don't explicitly tell you to run a command)
==========
==========
1. Write the command that you would use to change to the root directory.
----------

$cd /

==========
2. Write the command that you would use to change to your home directory.
----------

$cd ~ 


==========
3. Write the command that you would use to change to your Desktop folder.
----------

$cd ~/Desktop

==========
4. What's the absolute path to your home directory?
----------

$cd ~

==========
5. What's the absolute path to your Desktop directory?
----------

$cd ~/Desktop

==========
6. What's the relative path to your Desktop directory?
----------

$cd /User/ms.akinola/Desktop

==========
7. If you're in your home directory, what's the relative path to your Desktop directory?
----------

$cd /User/ms.akinola/Desktop

==========
8. If you're in your home directory, how would you create a new directory on your desktop called stuff without changing your directory?  Write your command below.
----------

$mkdir Desktop/stuff

==========
9. If you're in your root directory, how would you create a new directory on your desktop called more-stuff without changing your directory?  Write your command below.
----------

$mkdir ~/Desktop/More-Stuff

==========
10. If you're in your Desktop directory, how would you create a new directory on your desktop called even-more-stuff?  Write your command below.
----------

$mkdir Even-More-Stuff

==========
11. If you're in your home directory, how would you change to the directory right above it using a relative path (it should bring you to /Users)?  Write your command below.
----------

$cd ..
$pwd 
/Users

==========
12. If you're in your Desktop directory, how would you change to two directories right above it (again, this should be /Users) using a relative path?  Write your command below.
----------

$cd ../..
$pwd
/Users

==========
13. What's the shortcut for changing to the directory that you were just previously in?  For example, if I were in /Volumes... and I changed to /Users/profesor/Desktop, what's a quick way of changing to /Volumes without writing something like cd /Volumes?
----------

//Note: bash saves command line history. You can print in on the commmand line using $history command and then $!(followed by the nummber where the command is saved)

//Or just use <UP> button to scroll through previous entries

$history
$!519

            OR

<UP>
<UP>

==========
14. How would you show all of the files (including hidden ones) with detailed (long) information that are on you're Desktop if you're in your home directory?  Write your command below.
----------

$ls -l Desktop

//Command works without needing to change directory to Desktop. Is that odd?

==========
Optional Challenge:

a. Create the following directory structure on...

$mkdir Desktop/mystuff

b. A folder called my-stuff should be on your desktop.  There should be two additional directories within it: archived, current.

 $cd mystuff
 $mkdir archived current
 
           OR
 $mkdir -p mystuff/archived
 $mkdir -p mystuff/current

c. Determine the name of your computer.

Macbook

d. Create another directory in my-stuff that's the same name as your computer.

$mkdir -p Desktop/mystuff/Macbook Pro

e. Determine which folder in my-stuff was created most recently by using ls.  (there are some flags that help with this).

$ls -l

f. Remove that folder.

$rmdir Macbook
$rm -rf Macbook

g. Show all of the commands that you used to complete the above exercise.  (for example, how did you determine which folder in my-stuff was the most recent?).  Use the command: history ... to help you remember what you did!  Paste the commands below.

  568  cd ~
  569  mkdir Desktop/mystuff
  570  cd Desktop
  571  ls -a
  572  mkdir -p mystuff/archived
  573  mkdir -p mystuff/current
  574  mkdir -p mystuff/Macbook
  575  cd mystuff
  576  ls -l
  577  rmdir Macbook 
  578  history
